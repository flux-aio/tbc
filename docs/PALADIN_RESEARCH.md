## 2. Retribution Paladin Rotation & Strategies

### Core Mechanic: Seal Twisting
Seal twisting is THE defining mechanic of TBC Ret Paladin. It exploits the ~0.4s server batching window to proc two seals on a single auto-attack swing.

**How it works:**
1. Have Seal of Command active before your melee swing
2. ~0.4 seconds before the swing lands, cast Seal of Blood (or Martyr)
3. The swing processes BOTH seals: Command's 7 PPM proc + Blood's guaranteed +35% weapon dmg
4. This is approximately a 13% DPS increase over non-twisting

**Key rules:**
- Always use **Seal of Command Rank 1** (base ID 20375) while twisting — saves mana (65 vs 280); proc damage comes from the proc itself, not seal rank
- Never Judge Seal of Command — only Judge Seal of Blood
- Requires a swing timer for the 0.4s window
- wowsims constant: `twistWindow = 399 * time.Millisecond`
- After judging, re-seal Command(R1) immediately, then twist to Blood before next swing

**Seal Twist Cycle:**
```
Swing lands (both seals proc)
  → You now have Seal of Blood active
  → Judge Seal of Blood (off-GCD!)
  → Re-apply Seal of Command (R1)
  → Wait for 0.4s before next swing
  → Cast Seal of Blood
  → Swing lands (both seals proc again)
  → Repeat
```

### Vengeance Talent
- Each melee/spell crit grants +1 stack of Vengeance buff (ID: 20059)
- Per stack: +5% physical and Holy damage (at 5/5 talent)
- Stacks to 3 max = +15% total damage
- Duration: 30 seconds per stack
- 100% proc rate on any crit — with ~30% crit rate, near-100% uptime

### Single Target Rotation (from wowsims `rotation.go`)
The wowsims retribution rotation operates in three phases: opener, main rotation, and low-mana fallback.

```
OPENER:
1. Cast selected Judgement (Wisdom or Crusader depending on config)
2. Cast Seal of Command (R1)
3. Cast Seal of Blood → enable auto-attacks → begin twist cycle

MAIN ROTATION (priority order, on GCD ready):
1. Complete Seal Twist — if SoC active AND in twist window → cast Seal of Blood
2. Crusader Strike — if ready AND not about to twist AND (SoB active OR GCD < time_to_swing)
3. Prep Twist — if SoC inactive AND next Judge CD > latest twist start → cast Seal of Command (R1)
4. Judgement of Blood — when SoB active AND about to twist (Judge → lose SoB → apply SoC → twist back)
5. Reapply Seal of Blood — if no seal active AND not about to twist (catch-all)
6. Fillers (only when no twist planned AND won't clip CS or twist):
   a. Exorcism — if demon/undead target AND mana > 40% max
   b. Consecration — if configured AND mana > 60% max

LOW MANA MODE (mana ≤ 1000 AND SoC not active):
- Roll Seal of Blood with Judgement when expiring
- Cast Crusader Strike on CD (unless seal would expire mid-cast)
- Avoid actions that cause seal drops
- No twisting — just maintain SoB + CS
```

### Rotation Variants (from wowsims)
- **Normal**: 1 Crusader Strike + 1 Seal Twist per auto-attack cycle
- **Under Bloodlust**: 1 Crusader Strike + 2 Seal Twists per cycle (faster swing speed = more GCDs between swings)

### Twist Scheduling Logic (from wowsims)
The sim schedules actions for the next occurrence of:
- Auto-attack swing landing
- Twist window opening (swing_time - 0.399s)
- GCD becoming ready
- Judgement coming off CD
- Crusader Strike coming off CD

**Will-twist condition**: `time_to_swing > spell_GCD + ability_GCD` AND `next_swing + spell_GCD <= next_CS_CD + delay`

### Execute Phase (target <20% HP)
- Same rotation but add Hammer of Wrath on CD (1.0s cast, 6s CD, 30yd range)
- Hammer of Wrath is a ranged spell — use between melee swings
- Priority: Judgement > CS > Hammer of Wrath > Twist > Fillers

### Mana Thresholds (from wowsims)
- **Exorcism**: only cast when `current_mana > max_mana * 0.40`
- **Consecration**: only cast when `current_mana > max_mana * 0.60`
- **Low mana mode**: triggers when `mana ≤ 1000` — drops twisting entirely

### State Tracking Needed

## 3. Protection Paladin Rotation & Strategies

### Core Mechanic: Spell-Based Threat
Prot Paladin generates threat primarily through Holy spell damage, not melee. All Holy threat is amplified by Righteous Fury (+90%, +6% DR with Improved RF talent). This makes Prot the **best AoE tank** in TBC.

### Holy Shield Mechanics
- **Duration**: 10s / **Cooldown**: 10s (100% uptime possible)
- **Charges**: 4 baseline, **8 with Improved Holy Shield** (2/2 Prot talent)
- **Block chance**: +30% while active
- **Damage per block**: 155 Holy (R4) scaled by ~5% spell power coefficient
- **Threat**: +35% additional threat on Holy Shield block damage
- **Mana**: 280
- **CRITICAL**: Must maintain 100% uptime for crushing blow prevention (need 102.4% total avoidance+block)

### Spiritual Attunement (Primary Mana Source)
- Passive: 10% of healing received from OTHER players = mana (R2 at level 66)
- Post-patch 2.1: overhealing does NOT count
- This transforms mana into a "rage-like" resource: take damage → receive heals → get mana
- Key implication: if not taking damage (offtanking), mana can be a problem

### Single Target (Boss) Threat Priority (from wowsims `rotation.go`)
The wowsims protection rotation uses this `OnGCDReady()` priority:

```
PRE-CHECK: Righteous Fury — ALWAYS active (toggle check; never let it drop)

SEAL & JUDGEMENT CYCLING:
  If using Seal of Wisdom judgement:
    → Judge (applies JoW debuff) → switch to Seal of Righteousness
  If using Seal of Light judgement:
    → Judge (applies JoL debuff) → switch to Seal of Righteousness

MAIN PRIORITY:
1. Establish Seal of Righteousness (base seal for threat)
2. Holy Shield — if PrioritizeHolyShield enabled (100% uptime)
3. Consecration — on CD (8s)
4. Judgement of Righteousness + re-seal SoR combo
5. Exorcism — if target is undead/demon AND mana > 40% max
6. Holy Shield — if not prioritized earlier (fallback slot)

ON OOM: Mark out-of-mana, pause 5 seconds before retrying
```

**Key insight from wowsims**: Avenger's Shield is NOT in the `OnGCDReady()` rotation — it's used as a pull ability only, not part of the sustained threat rotation. The `nextCDAt()` function only tracks Holy Shield, Judgement, and Consecration readiness.

**`PrioritizeHolyShield` setting**: When enabled, Holy Shield fires before Consecration. When disabled, it falls to a lower priority slot. Default should be enabled (crushing blow prevention).

### Seal Choice for Tanking
- **Primary**: Seal of Righteousness — flat Holy per swing, consistent threat
- **Judgement cycling**: Seal of Wisdom → Judge → Seal of Righteousness (for mana); or Seal of Light → Judge → SoR (for healing)
- **Long fights (Alliance)**: Seal of Vengeance — stacking DoT, superior TPS at 5 stacks
- **Mana recovery**: Seal of Wisdom judging cycle (from wowsims pattern)
- **Never**: Seal of Blood — self-damage is counterproductive for tanks

### AoE Tanking (Prot Paladin Specialty)
```
Pull:
1. Avenger's Shield (3 targets, 6s daze)
2. Consecration immediately (8yd AoE, 8s)
3. Holy Shield (block dmg from all attackers)

Sustain:
4. Re-Consecrate on CD (8s)
5. Re-Holy Shield on CD (10s)
6. Tab-target Judgement for snap threat
7. Seal of Wisdom for mana sustain on large packs
8. Retribution Aura (passive retaliation dmg)
```

### State Tracking Needed
```lua
local prot_state = {
    righteous_fury_active = false,
    holy_shield_active = false,
    holy_shield_duration = 0,
    sov_stacks = 0,       -- Seal of Vengeance DoT stacks on target (0-5)
    sov_duration = 0,
    below_ardent_defender = false,  -- HP < 35%
}

local function get_prot_state(context)
    if context._prot_valid then return prot_state end
    context._prot_valid = true

    prot_state.righteous_fury_active = (Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(25780) or 0) > 0
    prot_state.holy_shield_active = (Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(27179) or 0) > 0
    prot_state.holy_shield_duration = Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(27179) or 0

    -- Seal of Vengeance tracking (Alliance)
    prot_state.sov_stacks = Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffsStacks(31803) or 0
    prot_state.sov_duration = Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(31803) or 0

    prot_state.below_ardent_defender = context.hp < 35

    return prot_state
end
```

## 4. Holy Paladin Rotation & Strategies

### Core Mechanic: Efficient Single-Target Healing
Holy Paladin is primarily a tank healer in TBC. The "rotation" is reactive — choosing between Flash of Light (efficient) and Holy Light (powerful) based on damage intake.

### Flash of Light vs Holy Light
- **Flash of Light (R7)**: 1.5s cast, 180 mana, 448-502 HP. Very mana-efficient. Use for moderate damage.
- **Holy Light (R11)**: 2.5s cast (2.0s with Light's Grace), 840 mana, 2551-2837 HP. Use for heavy damage.
- **Rule of thumb**: FoL when target is above 60% HP; HL when below 60% or big hits incoming.

### Light's Grace Talent
- After casting Holy Light, next HL cast time reduced by 0.5s for 15s (2.5s → 2.0s)
- Maintain this buff by casting HL periodically — even one HL every 15s keeps it rolling
- Buff ID: 31834

### Illumination Talent (Critical for Mana)
- 5/5: 100% chance that critical heals return 60% of base mana cost
- FoL crit: ~108 mana returned; HL crit: ~504 mana returned
- Makes crit an extremely valuable stat for Holy Paladins

### Divine Favor + Holy Shock Combo
- Divine Favor (20216): Next heal is guaranteed crit, 2 min CD
- Best used with Holy Light for maximum healing + Illumination mana return
- Or with Holy Shock for instant guaranteed crit heal in emergencies

### Divine Illumination (TBC 41-pt Talent)
- 50% mana cost reduction for all spells for 15s, 3 min CD
- Use during periods of heavy Holy Light spam for massive mana savings

### Judgement Usage While Healing
- Maintain Judgement of Light (27163) or Wisdom (27164) on boss when safe to do so
- Keep Seal of Wisdom active for passive mana from own melee hits (if in melee range)
- Only judge when it won't cost healing uptime — raid survival always takes priority

### Healing Priority
```
Emergency:
1. Divine Favor + Holy Light — guaranteed crit big heal (2 min CD)
2. Holy Shock — instant emergency (15s CD, 931-987 HP)
3. Lay on Hands — last resort full heal (60/20 min CD)

Normal:
4. Holy Light — target below HL HP% threshold (heavy damage)
5. Flash of Light — target below FoL HP% threshold (moderate damage)

Utility:
6. Cleanse — remove debuffs from party
7. Judgement of Light/Wisdom — maintain on boss when safe
8. Seal of Wisdom — maintain for mana recovery
```

### State Tracking Needed
```lua
local holy_state = {
    lights_grace_active = false,
    lights_grace_duration = 0,
    divine_favor_active = false,
    divine_illumination_active = false,
    jol_on_target = false,
    jol_duration = 0,
    jow_on_target = false,
    jow_duration = 0,
}

local function get_holy_state(context)
    if context._holy_valid then return holy_state end
    context._holy_valid = true

    holy_state.lights_grace_active = (Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(31834) or 0) > 0
    holy_state.lights_grace_duration = Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(31834) or 0
    holy_state.divine_favor_active = (Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(20216) or 0) > 0
    holy_state.divine_illumination_active = (Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(31842) or 0) > 0

    -- Judgement tracking on target
    holy_state.jol_on_target = (Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(27163) or 0) > 0
    holy_state.jol_duration = Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(27163) or 0
    holy_state.jow_on_target = (Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(27164) or 0) > 0
    holy_state.jow_duration = Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(27164) or 0

    return holy_state
end
```

---

## 5. AoE Rotation (All Specs)

### Retribution AoE
Limited options. Consecration (660 mana, 8s CD) is the primary and only real AoE ability.
- Consecration on CD
- Continue Seal twisting + Judging for single-target damage on priority target
- Very mana-expensive; avoid on long AoE packs unless mana is healthy

### Protection AoE (BEST AoE Tank in TBC)
```
1. Avenger's Shield on pull (3 targets, 6s daze)
2. Consecration immediately (8yd AoE)
3. Holy Shield (block dmg from all attackers — charges consumed by blocks)
4. Retribution Aura (passive retaliation to all melee attackers)
5. Seal of Wisdom for mana sustain on large packs
6. Tab-target Judgement for snap threat on stragglers
7. Re-Consecrate + Re-Holy Shield on CD
8. Holy Wrath vs Undead/Demon packs (60s CD, AoE stun)
```

### Holy AoE
Not applicable — healers don't AoE.

---

## 6. Shared Utility & Defensive Strategies

### Emergency Defense (Middleware candidates)
1. **Divine Shield** (642) — 12s full immunity; 5 min CD; can't attack; Forbearance
   - Use when: about to die and no other option
   - Note: Forbearance (25771) prevents DS/DP/BoP/LoH for 1 min
2. **Lay on Hands** (27154) — full HP heal; drains all mana; 60/20 min CD; Forbearance
   - Use when: critically low HP and LoH will save a wipe
3. **Divine Protection** (5573) — -50% all dmg 12s; 5 min CD; Forbearance
   - Prot spec: use when damage is heavy but still need to tank
4. **Blessing of Protection** (10278) — 10s physical immunity on target; Forbearance
   - Not for self (can't attack); use on friendly targets

### Dispel/Utility
1. **Cleanse** (4987) — remove poison + disease + magic (magic w/ Holy talent)
2. **Hammer of Justice** (10308) — 6s stun interrupt, 60/40s CD
3. **Righteous Defense** (31789) — taunt 3 mobs off friendly, 8s CD

### Forbearance Mechanic (Critical Implementation Note)
- Debuff ID: 25771, 1 min duration
- Applied by: Divine Shield, Divine Protection, Blessing of Protection, Lay on Hands, Avenging Wrath
- While active: CANNOT use any of the above abilities
- Must track Forbearance to prevent attempting blocked abilities
- Ret consideration: Avenging Wrath causes Forbearance → no emergency DS for 1 min

---

## 7. Mana Management System

### Retribution Mana (thresholds from wowsims)
1. **Spiritual Attunement**: SoB self-damage → healer tops you off → mana. Primary mana source.
2. **Seal of Command R1** for twisting: 65 mana vs 280 for max rank
3. **Sanctified Judgement** (talent): 33% chance to return 80% of Judgement mana
4. **Exorcism gate**: only when `mana > 40% max` (wowsims)
5. **Consecration gate**: only when `mana > 60% max` (wowsims)
6. **Low mana mode**: at `mana ≤ 1000` — drop twisting, just SoB + CS (wowsims)
7. **Judge Wisdom** on target if mana-starved on long fights (opener option in wowsims)
8. **Super Mana Potion** + **Dark Rune** on CD if mana is critical

### Protection Mana (from wowsims)
1. **Spiritual Attunement**: Primary mana source (taking damage + heals = mana)
2. **Seal of Wisdom → Judge → re-seal SoR** cycle: wowsims pattern for mana recovery
3. **Exorcism gate**: only when `mana > 40% max` (wowsims)
4. **OOM handling**: wowsims pauses rotation for 5 seconds on failed cast, then retries
5. **Priority trade-off**: Holy Shield > Consecration > Judgement when mana is low
   - Never drop Holy Shield uptime (crushing blow prevention)
   - Drop Consecration before Holy Shield if mana is critical

### Holy Mana
1. **Illumination**: 60% base mana on crit heals (strongest mana tool)
2. **Divine Illumination**: 50% cost for 15s, 3 min CD — use during HL spam phases
3. **Divine Favor + HL**: Guaranteed crit = guaranteed Illumination mana return
4. **Super Mana Potion** at ~70% mana (don't wait until empty)
5. **Dark Rune** on separate CD from potions
6. **Seal of Wisdom** + melee hits for passive mana when safe to be in melee
7. **Downrank**: Lower ranks of HL/FoL cost less mana for smaller heals

---

## 8. Cooldown Management

### Ret Cooldown Priority
1. **Avenging Wrath** — use on CD (+30% dmg 20s); pair with trinkets
   - Note: causes Forbearance → no emergency DS for 1 min
2. **Trinkets** — pair with Avenging Wrath window
3. **Haste Potion** — pair with AW for burst
4. **Racial** — Arcane Torrent (Blood Elf: mana + silence) or Stoneform (Dwarf)

### Prot Cooldown Priority
1. **Holy Shield** — 100% uptime first, always (10s/10s)
2. **Avenger's Shield** — on CD for threat (30s)
3. **Avenging Wrath** — optional for threat burst; costs Forbearance
4. **Trinkets** — pair with threat needs or defensive needs
5. **Ironshield Potion** — for heavy physical damage phases

### Holy Cooldown Priority
1. **Divine Illumination** — on CD during heavy healing phases (3 min, 15s)
2. **Divine Favor + Holy Light** — guaranteed crit big heal (2 min CD)
3. **Trinkets** — pair with healing-intensive phases
4. **Lay on Hands** — emergency only (60/20 min CD)

## 10. Strategy Breakdown Per Playstyle

### Retribution Playstyle Strategies (priority order, from wowsims `rotation.go`)
```
[1]  AvengingWrath          — off-GCD, use on CD (+30% dmg 20s)
[2]  Trinkets               — off-GCD, pair with AW window
[3]  Racial                 — off-GCD (Arcane Torrent / Stoneform)
[4]  CompleteSealTwist      — if SoC active + in twist window → cast SoB
[5]  JudgeSealOfBlood       — off-GCD, when SoB active AND about to twist
[6]  CrusaderStrike         — 6s CD, if not about to twist; refreshes all Judgement debuffs
[7]  PrepSealTwist          — cast SoC(R1) if twist planned AND SoC inactive AND Judge won't interfere
[8]  HammerOfWrath          — target below 20% HP (filler slot)
[9]  Exorcism               — Undead/Demon only, mana > 40% (filler slot)
[10] Consecration           — if enabled, mana > 60% (filler slot, won't clip CS or twist)
[11] MaintainSealFallback   — re-seal Blood if no seal active AND not twisting (catch-all)
```
Note: Low-mana mode (≤1000 mana) drops twisting entirely — just SoB + Judge + CS.
Fillers [8-10] only fire when no twist is planned AND sufficient time before next event.

### Protection Playstyle Strategies (priority order, from wowsims `rotation.go`)
```
[1]  RighteousFuryCheck     — ensure RF buff active (toggle on)
[2]  SealJudgeCycle         — if using JoW/JoL: Judge utility seal → switch to SoR
[3]  EstablishSeal          — ensure Seal of Righteousness active (base seal)
[4]  HolyShield             — 100% uptime (if PrioritizeHolyShield); 10s/10s
[5]  Consecration           — on CD (8s) for threat
[6]  JudgeRighteousness     — Judge SoR for damage + re-seal SoR
[7]  Exorcism               — Undead/Demon only, mana > 40%
[8]  HolyShieldFallback     — if not prioritized earlier (lower slot)
[9]  AvengingWrath          — optional threat burst (off-GCD)
[10] Trinkets               — with threat needs (off-GCD)
```
Note: Avenger's Shield is NOT in the wowsims sustained rotation — it's a pull-only ability.
The sim tracks next CD via: Holy Shield, Judgement, Consecration readiness only.
OOM handling: pause 5 seconds before retrying rotation.

### Holy Playstyle Strategies (priority order)
```
[1]  DivineFavor            — off-GCD, guaranteed crit next heal (2 min CD)
[2]  DivineIllumination     — off-GCD, -50% mana cost 15s (3 min CD)
[3]  HolyShockHeal          — instant emergency (15s CD, < HS HP% threshold)
[4]  HolyLight              — target below HL HP% threshold (heavy damage)
[5]  FlashOfLight           — target below FoL HP% threshold (moderate damage)
[6]  JudgementMaintain      — maintain JoL/JoW on boss when safe
[7]  SealMaintain           — keep Seal of Wisdom active
[8]  Cleanse                — dispel debuffs on party
```

### Shared Middleware (all specs)
```
[MW-500]  DivineShield        — emergency self-save at critical HP (check Forbearance!)
[MW-450]  LayOnHands          — emergency full heal (check Forbearance!)
[MW-400]  RecoveryItems       — healthstone, healing potion

## Key Implementation Notes

### Playstyle Detection
Paladin has NO stances/forms (unlike Druid). Playstyle must be determined by:
- **User setting** (dropdown: "retribution", "protection", "holy")
- Could auto-detect via talent check (Crusader Strike = Ret, Avenger's Shield = Prot, Holy Shock = Holy), but user setting is simpler and more reliable

### No Idle Playstyle
Like Mage, Paladin doesn't shift forms. OOC behavior (buffs, seals, auras) handled via middleware with `requires_combat = false`.
`idle_playstyle_name = nil`

### extend_context Fields

### Seal Twisting Implementation Notes (from wowsims `rotation.go`)
Seal twisting is the most complex mechanic to implement in a rotation addon.

**Core timing** (from wowsims):
1. **Swing timer**: Use `Player:GetSwing(1)` + `Player:GetSwingStart(1)` to track melee auto-attack timing
2. **Twist window**: 0.399 seconds before swing lands (`twistWindow = 399ms`)
3. **In twist window check**: `current_time >= next_swing - 0.399 AND current_time < next_swing`
4. **Will-twist condition**: `time_to_swing > spell_GCD + ability_GCD` (enough time to prep)

**State machine** (derived from wowsims event scheduling):
- BLOOD_ACTIVE → Judge SoB (off-GCD) → Cast SoC(R1) → COMMAND_ACTIVE
- COMMAND_ACTIVE → wait for twist window → Cast SoB → TWIST_PENDING
- TWIST_PENDING → swing lands (both seals proc) → BLOOD_ACTIVE → repeat

**Interaction with Crusader Strike**:
- CS fires between twists when GCD allows
- CS must NOT fire if it would miss the twist window
- wowsims checks: `SoB active OR spell_GCD < time_to_swing` before allowing CS

**Low-mana fallback** (mana ≤ 1000):
- Drop twisting entirely — just roll SoB + Judge when expiring + CS on CD
- Avoid seal drops (don't Judge if it would leave you sealless)

**Edge cases**:
- Haste effects (Bloodlust) change swing speed → shorter twist windows, more GCDs between swings
- Parry haste from boss can shift timing
- wowsims schedules pending actions at: next swing, twist window start, GCD ready, Judge ready, CS ready

**Fallback**: If user disables twisting, just maintain Seal of Blood and Judge on CD

### Judgement is Off-GCD
In TBC, Judgement (20271) does NOT trigger the GCD. This means:
- `is_gcd_gated = false` for Judgement strategies
- Can be cast between other abilities without losing DPS
- Judge immediately after CS or between seal swaps

### Forbearance Tracking
Critical to check Forbearance (25771) before attempting:
- Divine Shield (642)
- Divine Protection (5573)
- Blessing of Protection (10278)
- Lay on Hands (27154)
- Avenging Wrath (31884)

All of these apply Forbearance and are blocked by it. The middleware must check `context.forbearance_active` before showing these abilities.

### Paladin Class Color
```lua
Paladin = "f58cba"  -- Pink/rose (standard WoW class color)
```

### Faction-Specific Seal Handling
- **Horde**: Seal of Blood (31892) — primary DPS seal
- **Alliance**: Seal of the Martyr (348700, TBC Classic 2.5.1+) — SoB equivalent
- **Alliance (original TBC)**: Seal of Vengeance (31801) — stacking DoT, weaker for Ret
- Implementation must detect faction and offer the appropriate seal
- Use `UnitFactionGroup("player")` to detect Horde/Alliance

### Holy Paladin Healing Target
Unlike DPS specs which target enemies, Holy targets friendly units:
- Context needs to reference healing target (tank/mouseover/focus) not enemy target
- `spell:IsReady("target")` when target is friendly for heals
- Holy Shock can both damage (enemy target) and heal (friendly target)
- Cleanse targets friendly units
