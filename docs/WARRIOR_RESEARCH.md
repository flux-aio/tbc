## 2. Arms Warrior Rotation & Strategies

### Core Mechanic: Mortal Strike + Stance Dancing
Arms is the most mechanically complex Warrior spec due to stance-dependent abilities:
- **Mortal Strike** (any stance) — primary damage ability, 6s CD
- **Overpower** (Battle Stance only) — procs on target dodge, 5s CD, very high damage/rage
- **Whirlwind** (Berserker Stance only) — strong AoE/ST hit, 10s CD
- **Slam** (any stance) — filler between MS/WW/OP, 0.5s cast with Improved Slam

### Stance Dancing
Arms Warriors constantly swap between Battle and Berserker Stances:
- **Battle Stance**: For Overpower procs and Thunder Clap
- **Berserker Stance**: For Whirlwind and +3% crit
- **Tactical Mastery talent**: Retains up to 25 rage on stance swap (critical)
- Without Tactical Mastery, ALL rage is lost on swap

### Single Target Rotation
From wowsims and TBC Classic guides:
1. **Maintain Rend** (if Blood Frenzy talented — +4% physical damage for raid)
2. **Mortal Strike** on CD (6s, highest priority damage ability)
3. **Overpower** when available (after target dodge, switch to Battle if in Berserker)
4. **Whirlwind** on CD (switch to Berserker if in Battle)
5. **Slam** as filler (with Improved Slam: 0.5s cast, fits between auto-attacks)
6. **Execute** at <20% target HP (converts all extra rage into damage)
7. **Heroic Strike** as rage dump (>50+ rage, careful not to starve MS/WW)

### Slam Weaving
With Improved Slam (2/2), Slam has a 0.5s cast time. The technique:
- After an auto-attack lands, immediately Slam (0.5s cast)
- This fits between auto-attack swings without significantly delaying the next swing
- Only worth it with sufficient rage and between other ability cooldowns
- Stop Slam weaving when rage-starved or MS/WW coming off CD

### Execute Phase (<20% HP)
```
1. Execute (dump all rage into it)
2. Mortal Strike on CD (still higher priority if rage is limited)
3. More Execute
4. Heroic Strike queue if rage is overflowing (>80+)
```

### Arms State Tracking Needed
- `rend_active` — Rend debuff on target (for Blood Frenzy)
- `rend_duration` — remaining Rend duration
- `overpower_available` — target recently dodged (Overpower usable)
- `ms_cd` — Mortal Strike cooldown remaining
- `ww_cd` — Whirlwind cooldown remaining
- `target_below_20` — Execute phase check
- `slam_enabled` — Is Improved Slam talented (worth using)

---

## 3. Fury Warrior Rotation & Strategies

### Core Mechanic: Bloodthirst + Whirlwind + Rage Dumping
Fury is the simpler DPS spec. Lives primarily in Berserker Stance for +3% crit and Whirlwind access.

### Key Mechanics
- **Bloodthirst** (any stance): 45% AP as damage, 6s CD. Does NOT heal in TBC.
- **Whirlwind** (Berserker only): AoE melee, 10s CD (8s with Improved WW)
- **Rampage** (Fury 41-point, ID 30033): After melee crit, 5s window to activate. +50 AP per stack (max 5), 30s duration, 20 rage cost. Refresh when stacks < 5 or duration low.
- **Flurry** (talent): +25% attack speed for 3 swings after crit, maintains itself with dual-wield crits
- **Heroic Strike**: On-next-attack rage dump, NOT on GCD — queue it constantly when rage allows

### Dual Wield and Hit Rating
- TBC dual-wield has 19% miss penalty on off-hand (24% base miss vs boss)
- Hit cap for special attacks (Bloodthirst/WW): 9% (142 hit rating)
- Soft cap for dual-wield white hits: ~28% (additional hit beyond 9% helps)
- Precision talent (+3% hit) is critical

### Heroic Strike Queuing (Critical Mechanic)
Heroic Strike is NOT on the GCD. It replaces the next auto-attack:
- **Queue HS when rage > threshold** (~50-60 rage)
- **Cancel HS queue if rage drops** (avoid rage-starving BT/WW)
- HS removes the off-hand miss penalty for that swing (bug/feature in TBC)
- This makes HS queuing a DPS increase even ignoring the HS damage itself

### Single Target Rotation
From wowsims `normalRotation()`:
1. **Rampage** (maintain buff — if crit in last 5s AND stacks < 5 or duration low)
2. **Whirlwind** on CD (if PrioritizeWw enabled, before BT)
3. **Bloodthirst** on CD (6s, highest non-Rampage priority)
4. **Whirlwind** on CD (if PrioritizeWw disabled, after BT)
5. **Slam** as filler during auto-attack window (if Improved Slam 2/2)
6. **Overpower** on dodge proc (if enabled, rage ≥ threshold)
7. **Heroic Strike** queue as rage dump (when rage ≥ HsRageThreshold)
8. **Hamstring** — weave for Sword Spec procs (optional, rage ≥ threshold)

### Standard Rotation Cycle
```
BT → WW → BT → HS/wait → repeat
     (6s)  (10s)  (6s)

With Improved WW (8s CD):
BT → WW → BT → WW → BT → ...
```

### Execute Phase (<20% HP)
From wowsims `executeRotation()`:
```
1. Rampage (maintain buff even during execute)
2. Bloodthirst on CD (if UseBtDuringExecute)
3. Whirlwind on CD (if UseWwDuringExecute)
4. Execute (dump all rage — 925 + 21 × extraRage)
5. Heroic Strike ONLY if UseHsDuringExecute enabled (usually disabled)
```

### Fury State Tracking Needed
- `bt_cd` — Bloodthirst cooldown remaining
- `ww_cd` — Whirlwind cooldown remaining
- `rampage_active` — Rampage buff up
- `rampage_duration` — Rampage duration remaining
- `flurry_stacks` — Flurry buff stacks (3 swings)
- `target_below_20` — Execute phase check
- `hs_queued` — Heroic Strike is queued on next swing

---

## 4. Protection Warrior Rotation & Strategies

### Core Mechanic: Threat Priority + Shield Block Uptime
Protection is about maximizing threat-per-second (TPS) while maintaining survivability.

### Defensive Stance Threat Modifier
- Defensive Stance: +130% threat (1.3x multiplier)
- Combined with Defiance talent (+15%): effective ~1.495x threat multiplier
- Revenge has massive innate threat, making it highest TPS-per-rage

### Crushing Blow Prevention (TBC-Specific)
- Level 73 bosses (raid bosses) can land crushing blows (+50% damage)
- Shield Block pushes crushes off the attack table when combined with avoidance+block
- **Shield Block uptime is critical** on boss fights
- Shield Block: 5s duration, 5s CD → can maintain 100% uptime
- With Improved Shield Block: blocks 1 additional attack (2 total per Shield Block)

### Single Target Threat Rotation
From wowsims and TBC Protection guides:
1. **Shield Slam** on CD (highest single-target threat per use, 6s CD)
2. **Revenge** when available (proc-based: requires block/dodge/parry, highest threat/rage)
3. **Devastate** filler (applies/refreshes Sunder Armor + weapon damage, Prot talent)
4. **Sunder Armor** (if Devastate not talented, to build/maintain 5 stacks)
5. **Shield Block** on CD (crush prevention + Revenge proc enabler)
6. **Thunder Clap** debuff maintenance (requires Battle Stance swap!)
7. **Demoralizing Shout** if AP debuff not covered by another source
8. **Heroic Strike** as rage dump (only when rage > 60+, threat filler)

### Stance Swapping for Prot
Protection Warriors occasionally swap to Battle Stance for:
- **Thunder Clap** — attack speed debuff, important for damage reduction
- **Spell Reflection** — can also be used in Defensive Stance (requires shield)
- Swap back to Defensive immediately

### Shield Block Usage
```
On boss fights:
- Shield Block on CD (5s/5s — maintain 100% uptime)
- This is THE reason tanks can survive bosses in TBC

On trash:
- Less critical, use when expecting heavy damage
- Save rage for threat abilities if threat is an issue
```

### Prot State Tracking Needed
- `shield_slam_cd` — Shield Slam cooldown remaining
- `revenge_available` — Revenge proc active
- `sunder_stacks` — Sunder Armor stacks on target (0-5)
- `sunder_duration` — Sunder Armor duration remaining
- `shield_block_active` — Shield Block buff up
- `shield_block_cd` — Shield Block cooldown remaining
- `thunder_clap_debuff` — Thunder Clap debuff on target
- `demo_shout_debuff` — Demoralizing Shout debuff on target
- `has_shield` — Shield equipped check

---

## 5. AoE Rotation (All Specs)

### Arms AoE
1. **Sweeping Strikes** (Battle Stance, 30s CD) — next 5 melee attacks hit an additional target
2. Switch to Berserker → **Whirlwind** — with Sweeping Strikes up, massive AoE
3. **Thunder Clap** (Battle Stance) — AoE attack speed debuff
4. **Cleave** as rage dump instead of Heroic Strike (hits 2 targets)

### Fury AoE
1. **Whirlwind** on CD (Berserker Stance) — hits up to 4 targets
2. **Cleave** instead of Heroic Strike (2 targets, on-next-swing)
3. **Bloodthirst** on CD (single target but still highest priority)
4. Tab-target and maintain threat

### Protection AoE (AoE Tanking)
1. **Thunder Clap** (requires Battle Stance swap) — AoE slow + threat
2. **Demoralizing Shout** — AoE threat baseline
3. **Cleave** as rage dump (hits 2 targets, more AoE threat than HS)
4. **Devastate/Sunder** — tab-target to spread threat
5. **Revenge** when available — high threat even on single
6. **Shield Block** — maintain for survival
7. **Challenging Shout** (3 min CD) — AoE taunt emergency

---

## 6. Shared Utility & Defensive Strategies

### Emergency Defense (Middleware candidates)
1. **Last Stand** — +30% max HP for 20s (Prot talent, 10 min CD)
   - Use when: HP critically low, about to die
2. **Shield Wall** — 75% DR for 10s (30 min CD, Defensive Stance)
   - Use when: major damage incoming, tank buster mechanic
3. **Spell Reflection** — reflect next spell (10s CD, requires shield)
   - Use when: dangerous spell incoming, proactive defense
4. **Intimidating Shout** — AoE fear (3 min CD, emergency CC)

### Interrupts
1. **Pummel** — 10s CD, Berserker Stance
2. **Shield Bash** — 12s CD, Defensive Stance, requires shield
Note: Stance requirement means interrupt availability depends on current stance

### Utility
1. **Hamstring** — movement slow (10 rage, any stance)
2. **Disarm** — disarm target weapon (1 min CD, Defensive Stance)

### Self-Buff Maintenance (OOC)
1. **Battle Shout** — +305 AP (maintain at all times)
2. **Commanding Shout** — +1080 HP (alternative to Battle Shout)

---

## 7. Rage Management System

### Rage Generation
Warriors generate rage from:
1. **Damage dealt** (white hits, scaled by weapon damage and speed)
2. **Damage taken** (flat amount per hit received)
3. **Bloodrage** — 10 rage instant + 10 rage over 10s, 1 min CD, costs HP
4. **Berserker Rage** — generates rage if Improved Berserker Rage talented
5. **Charge** — generates 15 rage (OOC, Battle Stance)

### Rage Normalization Formula (TBC)
```
Rage = 15 * damage / (4 * weapon_speed * level_factor)
```
- Slower weapons generate more rage per hit (same rage per second on average)
- Instant attacks generate rage based on weapon damage component

### Rage Dump Thresholds (from wowsims)
- **Fury HS threshold**: Queue Heroic Strike when rage > 50-60
- **Arms HS threshold**: Queue Heroic Strike when rage > 50+ (after MS/WW budget)
- **Prot HS threshold**: Queue Heroic Strike when rage > 60+ (after Shield Slam/Revenge)
- **Execute phase**: Stop HS, dump all rage into Execute instead

### Stance Swap Rage Loss
- **Without Tactical Mastery**: ALL rage is lost on stance swap
- **With Tactical Mastery (max rank)**: Retain up to 25 rage
- This makes stance dancing expensive — minimize unnecessary swaps
- Budget swaps carefully: swap → use ability → swap back

[8]  HeroicStrikeQueue     — off-GCD, rage dump when rage > threshold
```

### Shared Middleware (all specs)
```
[MW-500]  LastStand            — emergency HP boost at critical HP (Prot talent)
[MW-490]  ShieldWall           — emergency DR at critical HP (Prot)

```

### AoE Strategies (triggered by enemy_count threshold)
```
When enemy_count >= aoe_threshold (configurable, default 3):
Arms: Sweeping Strikes → Whirlwind → Cleave dump
Fury: Whirlwind on CD → Cleave dump (instead of HS)
Prot: Thunder Clap → Demo Shout → Cleave dump → tab-Devastate
All specs: Cleave replaces Heroic Strike as rage dump
```

## Wowsims Verified Rotation Logic

Cross-referenced from `wowsims/tbc/sim/warrior/dps/rotation.go` and ability files.

### Wowsims DPS Rotation Architecture
The sim uses three main entry points:
- `OnGCDReady()` — main rotation when GCD is free
- `OnAutoAttack()` — Slam queuing + HS/Cleave queuing on auto-attack events
- `doRotation()` — orchestration: Thunder Clap stance swap → Sunder maintenance → normal/execute routing

### Wowsims normalRotation() Priority (Verified)
```
1. Rampage         — if talent learned AND crit in last 5s AND (stacks < 5 OR duration ≤ RampageCdThreshold)
2. Whirlwind       — if Rotation.PrioritizeWw enabled
3. Bloodthirst     — primary Fury ability
4. Mortal Strike   — primary Arms ability
5. Shield Slam     — (Prot hybrid? rarely used in DPS)
6. Whirlwind       — if Rotation.PrioritizeWw disabled (lower priority than BT/MS)
7. Debuff maintenance — Sunder Armor + Thunder Clap (skipped if highPrioSpellsOnly)
8. Overpower       — if UseOverpower AND rage ≥ OverpowerRageThreshold
9. Berserker Rage  — rage gen / fear immunity
10. Hamstring      — if UseHamstring AND rage ≥ HamstringRageThreshold
```

### Wowsims executeRotation() Priority (Verified)
```
1. Rampage         — maintain buff even during execute
2. Whirlwind       — if PrioritizeWw AND UseWwDuringExecute
3. Bloodthirst     — if UseBtDuringExecute
4. Mortal Strike   — if UseMsDuringExecute
5. Whirlwind       — if !PrioritizeWw AND UseWwDuringExecute
6. Debuff maintenance — (skipped if highPrioSpellsOnly)
7. Execute         — dump all rage (925 + 21 × extraRage base damage)
8. Berserker Rage  — rage gen
```

### Wowsims Configuration Fields
| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `UseSlam` | bool | — | Disabled if ImprovedSlam ≠ 2 |
| `UseSlamDuringExecute` | bool | — | Allow Slam in execute phase |
| `PrioritizeWw` | bool | — | WW before BT/MS in priority |
| `UseWwDuringExecute` | bool | — | Allow WW in execute phase |
| `UseBtDuringExecute` | bool | — | Allow BT in execute phase |
| `UseMsDuringExecute` | bool | — | Allow MS in execute phase |
| `UseHsDuringExecute` | bool | — | Allow HS queue in execute phase |
| `SunderArmor` | enum | — | None / HelpStack / Maintain |
| `UseOverpower` | bool | — | Use Overpower on dodge procs |
| `OverpowerRageThreshold` | int | — | Min rage for Overpower |
| `UseHamstring` | bool | — | Hamstring weave for procs |
| `HamstringRageThreshold` | int | — | Min rage for Hamstring |
| `MaintainDemoShout` | bool | — | Keep Demo Shout on target |
| `MaintainThunderClap` | bool | — | Keep TC on target (stance swaps!) |
| `HsRageThreshold` | int | — | Min rage to queue HS/Cleave |
| `RampageCdThreshold` | dur | — | Refresh Rampage below this duration |
| `slamLatency` | ms | — | User-configured reaction time |
| `slamGCDDelay` | ms | 400 | GCD overlap buffer for Slam |
| `slamMSWWDelay` | ms | 2000 | Don't Slam if MS/WW ready within this |

### Wowsims Slam Timing Logic
Slam is queued during auto-attack windows (NOT on GCD ready):
1. `OnAutoAttack()` fires → check `slamInRotation()` → `tryQueueSlam()`
2. Slam queues at `sim.CurrentTime + slamLatency` (simulates player reaction)
3. **Skip Slam if**: MS or WW comes off CD within `slamMSWWDelay` (default 2s)
4. **highPrioSpellsOnly flag**: Set when GCD overlaps with Slam timing window → only cast highest-priority abilities (BT/MS/WW), skip fillers
5. Slam delays auto-attacks: next swing = current time + cast time + swing speed

### Wowsims HS/Cleave Queue Logic
From `heroic_strike_cleave.go`:
- **HS cost**: `15 - ImprovedHeroicStrike - FocusedRage` (80% refund on miss)
- **Cleave cost**: `20 - FocusedRage`
- **Queue condition**: `CurrentRage() >= max(abilityCost, HsRageThreshold)`
- **Dequeue condition**: rage drops below cost on main-hand swing
- **Key TBC mechanic**: Queuing HS removes dual-wield miss penalty for that swing
- **Execute phase**: Only queue if `UseHsDuringExecute` enabled

### Wowsims Debuff Maintenance
- **Sunder Armor**: Maintain 5 stacks, refresh at ≤ 3s remaining (`SunderWindow`)
  - `HelpStack` mode: only help stack to 5, don't maintain duration
  - `Maintain` mode: keep stacks AND refresh timer
  - Uses Devastate if talented, otherwise Sunder Armor
- **Thunder Clap**: Refresh at ≤ 2s remaining (`DebuffRefreshWindow`)
  - Requires Battle Stance → sets `thunderClapNext` flag → swap → TC → 300ms delay → swap back
- **Demoralizing Shout**: Maintained if `MaintainDemoShout` enabled

### Wowsims Ability Formulas (Verified)
| Ability | Formula | Threat | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| Execute | 925 + 21 × extraRage | 1.25x | Consumes all rage, base cost 15 |
| Shield Slam | 420-440 + BlockValue | 305 flat bonus | 1.0x threat mult |
| Slam | 140% weapon damage | 70 flat bonus | 1.5s - 0.5s×ImprovedSlam |
| Overpower | weapon + 35 base | 0.75x | Reduced threat |
| Bloodthirst | 45% of AP | 1.0x | 80% refund on miss |
| Mortal Strike | weapon + 210 base | 1.0x | 80% refund on miss |
| Whirlwind | 100% weapon damage | 1.25x | Up to 4 targets, MH+OH |
| Rampage | — (buff, not damage) | — | 50 AP/stack, max 5, 20 rage |
| Deep Wounds | 20% × weapon avg × rank | 1.0x | 4 ticks @ 3s = 12s |

## Key Implementation Notes

### Playstyle Detection
Warrior has NO auto-detection via stances (unlike Druid). Playstyle must be determined by:
- **User setting** (dropdown: "arms", "fury", "protection")
- Warriors switch stances constantly within a playstyle, so stance ≠ spec
- Could auto-detect via talent check (MS=Arms, BT=Fury, Devastate=Prot) but user setting is more reliable

### Stance Constants
```lua
Constants.STANCE = {
    BATTLE = 1,      -- Player:GetStance() == 1
    DEFENSIVE = 2,   -- Player:GetStance() == 2
    BERSERKER = 3,   -- Player:GetStance() == 3
}

-- Wowsims-verified thresholds
Constants.SUNDER_REFRESH_WINDOW = 3    -- refresh Sunder at ≤ 3s remaining
Constants.TC_REFRESH_WINDOW = 2        -- refresh Thunder Clap at ≤ 2s remaining
Constants.STANCE_SWAP_DELAY = 0.3      -- 300ms delay after TC stance swap
Constants.EXECUTE_BASE_DAMAGE = 925    -- Execute: 925 + 21 × extraRage
Constants.EXECUTE_RAGE_SCALING = 21    -- per extra rage point
Constants.SUNDER_MAX_STACKS = 5
Constants.RAMPAGE_MAX_STACKS = 5
Constants.RAMPAGE_AP_PER_STACK = 50
```
Framework docs confirm: Warrior: 1=Battle, 2=Defensive, 3=Berserker

### No Idle Playstyle
Like Mage, Warrior doesn't need an idle playstyle. OOC behavior (shout maintenance, Bloodrage) handled via middleware with `requires_combat = false`.

### extend_context Fields

    return arms_state
end
```

### Fury State (context_builder)
```lua
local fury_state = {
    bt_cd = 0,
    ww_cd = 0,
    target_below_20 = false,
    rampage_duration = 0,

    prot_state.target_below_20 = context.target_hp < 20

    return prot_state
end
```

### Heroic Strike / Cleave as Next-Swing (Special Handling)
Heroic Strike and Cleave are unique — they are **on-next-attack** abilities:
- NOT on the GCD (can be queued at any time)
- Replace the next auto-attack swing with a special attack
- Can be cancelled before the swing lands
- Strategies should set `is_gcd_gated = false` for these
- Implementation note: need to track if HS/Cleave is already queued (`IsSpellCurrent()`)
```lua
-- Check if Heroic Strike is already queued
local hs_queued = A.HeroicStrike:IsSpellCurrent()
-- Only queue if not already queued and rage > threshold
if not hs_queued and context.rage > context.settings.fury_hs_rage_threshold then
    return A.HeroicStrike:Show(icon)
end
```

### Stance Requirements Table
Strategies must check stance before casting restricted abilities:
```lua
-- Stance requirements for key abilities
local STANCE_REQUIREMENTS = {
    -- Battle Stance (1) only
    Overpower = Constants.STANCE.BATTLE,
    ThunderClap = Constants.STANCE.BATTLE,
    Charge = Constants.STANCE.BATTLE,

    Taunt = Constants.STANCE.DEFENSIVE,
    SunderArmor = Constants.STANCE.DEFENSIVE,
    Devastate = Constants.STANCE.DEFENSIVE,
    Disarm = Constants.STANCE.DEFENSIVE,
    Intervene = Constants.STANCE.DEFENSIVE,

    -- Berserker Stance (3) only
    Whirlwind = Constants.STANCE.BERSERKER,
    Pummel = Constants.STANCE.BERSERKER,
    Intercept = Constants.STANCE.BERSERKER,
    BerserkerRage = Constants.STANCE.BERSERKER,
    Recklessness = Constants.STANCE.BERSERKER,

    -- Battle OR Defensive
    SpellReflection = {Constants.STANCE.BATTLE, Constants.STANCE.DEFENSIVE},
}

### Stance Swap Suggestion System
Like Druid form suggestions, the addon should NOT auto-swap stances but CAN suggest:
- Arms in Berserker → suggest Battle for Overpower (when dodge proc)
- Arms in Battle → suggest Berserker for Whirlwind (when WW off CD)
- Prot in Defensive → suggest Battle for Thunder Clap (when debuff expires)
- Use the A[1] suggestion icon pattern from the existing codebase
