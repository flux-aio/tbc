### IMPORTANT: Mechanics That Do NOT Exist in TBC
Do NOT implement these — they are Wrath of the Lich King (3.0+):
| Mechanic | Expansion | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Fan of Knives | Wrath (3.0) | AoE ability doesn't exist |
| Killing Spree | Wrath (3.0) | Combat 51pt talent doesn't exist |
| Shadow Dance | Wrath (3.0) | Subtlety 51pt talent doesn't exist |
| Tricks of the Trade | Wrath (3.0) | Threat redirect doesn't exist |
| Hunger for Blood | Wrath (3.0) | Assassination talent doesn't exist |
| Honor Among Thieves | Wrath (3.0) | Subtlety CP generation doesn't exist |
| Cut to the Chase | Wrath (3.0) | Envenom refreshing SnD doesn't exist |
| Mutilate from front | Wrath (3.0) | TBC Mutilate requires behind target |
| Envenom not consuming DP | Wrath (3.1+) | TBC Envenom CONSUMES Deadly Poison stacks |

**What IS new in TBC (vs Classic):**
- Cloak of Shadows (level 66 baseline)
- Shiv (level 70 trained) — instant poison application
- Envenom (level 62 trained) — consumes Deadly Poison stacks for burst
- Shadowstep (Subtlety 41pt talent) — teleport behind target
- Anesthetic Poison (TBC-only rank)
- Deadly Throw (not implemented — rarely used PVE)
- Cheat Death (Subtlety talent, passive)

## 2. Combat Rogue Rotation & Strategies

### Core Mechanic: Slice and Dice Uptime + Sustained DPS
Combat Rogue is the premier PVE DPS spec in TBC. Core identity:
- **Slice and Dice** must be maintained at all times (30% attack speed)
- **Sinister Strike** as primary combo point builder
- High white damage output with Combat talents (+OH damage, +hit, +weapon speed)
- **Blade Flurry** for sustained cleave and attack speed
- **Adrenaline Rush** for burst energy regen windows

### Single Target Rotation
From wowsims `rotation.go` (plan-based state machine) and TBC Classic guides:

**Key wowsims insight**: The sim uses ONE unified rotation for all specs — only the builder spell
differs (SS for Combat, Mutilate for Assassination, Hemorrhage for Subtlety). The finisher
priority and SnD/EA maintenance logic is identical across all three specs.

```
Opener (from Stealth):
1. Garrote (if no positional) OR Cheap Shot (for CP)
2. Slice and Dice at 1-2 CP (get uptime ASAP — "PlanSliceASAP")
3. Build to 5 CP → Rupture (if TTD > duration)
4. Build to 5 CP → Slice and Dice (maximal refresh — "PlanMaximalSlice")
5. Sustained rotation cycle

Sustained Rotation (wowsims "PlanNone" → decision tree):
1. If 0 CP → use builder (Sinister Strike)
2. If SnD not active → "PlanSliceASAP" (SnD at any CP count)
3. If maintaining Expose Armor:
   a. Calculate EA build time remaining
   b. If EA needs refresh soon → "PlanExposeArmor"
   c. If SnD needs refresh soon → "PlanMaximalSlice"
   d. Otherwise → build to 5 CP, use damage finisher, then prep for EA/SnD
4. If not maintaining EA:
   a. If SnD has enough time → "PlanFillBeforeSND" (damage finisher → SnD)
   b. If SnD needs refresh → "PlanMaximalSlice" (build to max CP → SnD)

Damage Finisher Priority (wowsims "tryUseDamageFinisher"):
1. Rupture — if enabled, not active, TTD > duration, and NOT during Blade Flurry multi-target
2. Eviscerate — fallback CP dump
Note: wowsims does NOT use Envenom in the default rotation. Rupture > Eviscerate only.
```

### Shiv for Deadly Poison Maintenance (wowsims `castBuilder`)
```
If UseShiv enabled AND Deadly Poison active on target AND DP duration < 2s:
  → Shiv (refreshes Deadly Poison via OH poison application)
Else:
  → Builder (Sinister Strike)
```

### Energy Pooling (wowsims `canPoolEnergy`)
- **Pool when**: fight > 6s remaining AND energy <= 50
- **During Adrenaline Rush**: pool threshold drops to <= 30
- **Pool before finishers**: if SnD/EA remaining > 2s, wait to pool energy
- **Never pool**: when SnD/EA about to expire (<= 1s remaining — emergency cast)

### Combat Strategies (priority order)
1. **Maintain Slice and Dice** — if not active or < 2s remaining, finisher at any CP count
2. **Blade Flurry** — off-GCD, use on CD
3. **Adrenaline Rush** — off-GCD, use on CD (pair with Blade Flurry)
4. **Trinkets** — off-GCD, pair with AR window
5. **Racial** — off-GCD (Blood Fury/Berserking)
6. **Expose Armor** — at 5 CP if enabled and debuff not active
7. **Rupture** — at 5 CP if debuff not active and TTD > threshold
8. **Eviscerate** — at 5 CP as CP dump
9. **Sinister Strike** — primary builder

### State Tracking Needed
- `snd_active` — Slice and Dice buff present
- `snd_duration` — remaining SnD duration
- `rupture_active` — Rupture debuff on target
- `rupture_duration` — remaining Rupture duration
- `blade_flurry_active` — Blade Flurry buff
- `adrenaline_rush_active` — Adrenaline Rush buff
- `expose_armor_active` — Expose Armor debuff on target

---

## 3. Assassination Rogue Rotation & Strategies

### Core Mechanic: Mutilate + Envenom + Poison Synergy
Assassination in TBC revolves around:
- **Mutilate** as CP builder (2 CP per use, requires daggers both hands)
- **Deadly Poison** stacks on target (up to 5)
- **Envenom** as primary finisher (consumes Deadly Poison stacks for burst damage)
- **Cold Blood** for guaranteed crit on key finishers
- **Find Weakness** talent: +10% armor pen for 10s after stealth opener

### Single Target Rotation
From wowsims `rotation.go` (same unified rotation, Builder=Mutilate) and TBC Classic guides:

**wowsims note**: The sim uses Mutilate as the builder but the same SnD/Rupture/Eviscerate
finisher logic as Combat. Envenom is registered as a spell but NOT used in the default rotation —
the damage finisher path is Rupture > Eviscerate only. Community guides DO recommend Envenom
as an option, so we include it as a configurable setting.

```
Opener (from Stealth):
1. Garrote (applies DoT + Find Weakness proc) OR Cheap Shot (for stunlock)
2. Mutilate → Slice and Dice (at 2+ CP, get uptime ASAP)
3. Mutilate → Mutilate → Rupture at 4-5 CP (if TTD > duration)
4. Sustained rotation cycle

Sustained Rotation (same plan-based logic as Combat):
1. ALWAYS maintain Slice and Dice (highest priority finisher)
2. Maintain Rupture (if TTD > duration) — skipped during Blade Flurry multi-target
3. Mutilate to build combo points (2 CP each, very fast building)
4. Shiv to refresh Deadly Poison if duration < 2s (wowsims pattern)
5. At 4-5 CP: SnD > Rupture > Envenom (optional) > Eviscerate

Finisher Priority (at 4-5 CP):
1. Slice and Dice (if < 2s remaining or not active)
2. Rupture (if not active and TTD > duration)
3. Envenom (optional — when Deadly Poison stacks >= threshold, if enabled)
4. Eviscerate (fallback CP dump)

Envenom Notes (TBC-specific):
- CONSUMES all Deadly Poison stacks on target
- Damage = 60 + (180 + 40 Vile Poisons) × consumed stacks, scales with CP
- Energy cost: 35 (25 with Assassination T5 4pc)
- Must let Deadly Poison restack after each Envenom
- Do NOT Envenom with only 1 stack — wait for 4-5 stacks
- Shiv can be used to rebuild DP stacks faster after Envenom
```

### Assassination Strategies (priority order)
1. **Maintain Slice and Dice** — highest priority finisher
2. **Cold Blood** — off-GCD, pair with Envenom or Eviscerate
3. **Trinkets** — off-GCD, use on CD
4. **Racial** — off-GCD (Blood Fury/Berserking)
5. **Rupture** — at 4-5 CP if debuff not active and TTD > threshold
6. **Envenom** — at 4-5 CP when Deadly Poison stacks >= setting threshold
7. **Eviscerate** — at 4-5 CP if no Deadly Poison stacks or Envenom disabled
8. **Mutilate** — primary builder (2 CP, requires behind target + daggers)

### State Tracking Needed
- `snd_active` — Slice and Dice buff present
- `snd_duration` — remaining SnD duration
- `rupture_active` — Rupture debuff on target
- `rupture_duration` — remaining Rupture duration
- `deadly_poison_stacks` — Deadly Poison stacks on target (0-5)
- `deadly_poison_duration` — remaining DP debuff duration
- `cold_blood_active` — Cold Blood buff active
- `find_weakness_active` — Find Weakness debuff on target

---

## 4. Subtlety Rogue Rotation & Strategies

### Core Mechanic: Hemorrhage + Shadowstep + Opener Burst
Subtlety is primarily PVP in TBC but has a viable PVE build:
- **Hemorrhage** as primary builder (35 energy, cheaper than SS)
- **Shadowstep** for teleport + 20% damage buff on next ability
- **Premeditation** for 2 free CP from stealth
- **Preparation** resets key CDs (Vanish, Sprint, Evasion, Cold Blood, Shadowstep)
- **Master of Subtlety** talent: +10% damage for 6s after leaving stealth

### Single Target Rotation
From TBC Classic guides (Sub is not well-simulated in wowsims):

```
Opener (from Stealth):
1. Premeditation → Shadowstep → Ambush (or Cheap Shot)
   (Premed gives 2 CP, Shadowstep buffs +20%, Ambush crits hard)
2. Slice and Dice at 3+ CP
3. Build with Hemorrhage → Rupture at 5 CP
4. Sustained rotation

Sustained Rotation:
1. ALWAYS maintain Slice and Dice
2. Maintain Hemorrhage debuff on target (10 charges, 15s — very easy to maintain)
3. Maintain Rupture (if TTD > duration)
4. Hemorrhage to build combo points
5. At 5 CP: SnD > Rupture > Eviscerate

Shadowstep Usage (PVE):
- Use on CD for +20% damage on next ability
- Best paired with Hemorrhage or Sinister Strike (instant abilities)
- Teleports behind target (useful for positional requirements)
```

### Subtlety Strategies (priority order)
1. **Maintain Slice and Dice** — highest priority finisher
2. **Shadowstep** — off-GCD(?), use on CD for +20% dmg buff
3. **Preparation** — off-GCD, use to reset Shadowstep/Vanish/Cold Blood
4. **Trinkets** — off-GCD, use on CD
5. **Racial** — off-GCD
6. **Rupture** — at 5 CP if debuff not active and TTD > threshold
7. **Eviscerate** — at 5 CP as CP dump
8. **Hemorrhage** — primary builder (keeps debuff active passively)

### State Tracking Needed
- `snd_active` — Slice and Dice buff present
- `snd_duration` — remaining SnD duration
- `rupture_active` — Rupture debuff on target
- `rupture_duration` — remaining Rupture duration
- `hemo_debuff_active` — Hemorrhage debuff on target
- `hemo_debuff_charges` — remaining charges (max 10)
- `shadowstep_buff_active` — +20% damage buff from Shadowstep

---

## 5. AoE Rotation (All Specs)

Rogue has **extremely limited AoE** in TBC. There is NO Fan of Knives (Wrath only).

### Available AoE Options
1. **Blade Flurry** (Combat talent) — strikes 1 extra nearby target for 15s
   - This is the only real "AoE" ability
   - Use on CD when 2+ targets are present
2. **Tab-target Rupture/SnD** — spread bleeds manually
3. **Single-target focus** — Rogue is fundamentally a single-target class in TBC

### Spec-Specific AoE
- **Combat**: Blade Flurry is the strongest cleave. With AR + BF, very strong 2-target DPS
- **Assassination/Subtlety**: No meaningful AoE tools

### AoE Strategy
```
When enemy_count >= 2 and Blade Flurry available:
1. Activate Blade Flurry (cleave for 15s)
2. Continue single-target rotation (cleave happens automatically)
3. Consider Adrenaline Rush + Blade Flurry for max cleave burst
4. SKIP Rupture during Blade Flurry multi-target (wowsims: Eviscerate is better for cleave)
   — Rupture doesn't cleave, Eviscerate front-loads damage that BF copies
```

---

## 6. Shared Utility & Defensive Strategies

### Emergency Defense (Middleware candidates)
1. **Evasion** — +50% dodge, 15s (5 min CD)
   - Use when: taking melee damage, pulling aggro
2. **Cloak of Shadows** — remove spells + 90% spell resist, 5s (1 min CD)
   - Use when: harmful magic effects on player, spell damage incoming
3. **Vanish** — emergency stealth (5 min CD)
   - Use when: HP critically low, need to drop aggro
4. **Feint** — threat reduction (10s CD, 20 energy)
   - Use when: high threat, proactive threat management

### Interrupt
1. **Kick** — interrupt + 5s school lockout (10s CD, 25 energy)
   - Very efficient, low CD interrupt

### Self-Preservation
1. **Sprint** — +70% speed 15s (escape mechanics, positioning)
2. **Blind** — 10s disorient (emergency CC)
3. **Kidney Shot** — stun finisher (emergency stun on add)

### Stealth Openers (Pre-combat only)
- Handled as opening rotation, not middleware
- Garrote (DoT + silence with talent) — default PVE opener
- Cheap Shot (2 CP + stun) — when stun is needed
- Ambush (high burst) — Subtlety/PVP or with Shadowstep

---

## 7. Energy Management System

### Energy Regeneration
- **Base**: 20 energy per 2 seconds (10 energy/tick)
- **Adrenaline Rush**: doubles to 40 energy per 2 seconds
- **Thistle Tea**: instant +100 energy, 5 min CD with 2 min shared conjured CD
- **Combat Potency** (Combat talent): 20% chance for 15 energy on OH hit
- **Relentless Strikes** (talent): 20% per CP to restore 25 energy on finisher (100% at 5 CP)
- No trackable buff for Relentless Strikes (passive energy return)

### Energy Recovery Priority
1. **Thistle Tea** — +100 energy instant (wowsims: use when energy <= 40 to avoid capping)
2. **Haste Potion** — +400 haste rating 15s (more white hits = more Combat Potency procs)
   - Use with AR + BF window for max DPS
3. **Adrenaline Rush** — doubled energy regen for 15s (Combat only)

### Energy Pooling Rules (from wowsims `canPoolEnergy`)
- **Pool threshold**: energy <= 50 (normal), energy <= 30 (during Adrenaline Rush)
- **Only pool when**: fight has > 6 seconds remaining
- **Pool before finishers**: if SnD/EA has > 2s remaining, delay finisher to accumulate energy
- **Emergency cast**: if SnD/EA has <= 1s remaining, cast immediately regardless of energy
- **Never sit at 0 CP**: if 0 CP, always use builder regardless of energy (no useful pooling with 0 CP)
- **No ability costs < 25 energy**: if energy < 25, simply wait (wowsims early exit)

## 8. Cooldown Management

### Combat Cooldown Priority
1. **Blade Flurry** + **Adrenaline Rush** — stack together for maximum burst
   - BF CD: 2 min, AR CD: 5 min
   - Use BF on CD, stack AR when both available
2. **Haste Potion** — during BF + AR window
3. **Trinkets** — pair with BF + AR
4. **Blood Fury / Berserking** — pair with BF + AR

### Assassination Cooldown Priority
1. **Cold Blood** — pair with Envenom (at 5 Deadly Poison stacks) for guaranteed crit
2. **Trinkets** — use on CD
3. **Blood Fury / Berserking** — use on CD

### Subtlety Cooldown Priority
1. **Shadowstep** — use on CD (30s CD, +20% damage buff)
2. **Preparation** — use after Shadowstep, Cold Blood, Vanish on CD
3. **Cold Blood** — pair with Eviscerate or Ambush (from Vanish)
4. **Vanish → Opener** — re-apply Find Weakness / Master of Subtlety
5. **Trinkets** — pair with burst windows

### Combat Playstyle Strategies (priority order)
```
[1]  MaintainSliceAndDice  — if SnD not active or duration < refresh_threshold
[2]  BladeFlurry           — off-GCD, use on CD (if talented + enabled)
[3]  AdrenalineRush        — off-GCD, use on CD (if talented + enabled)

[10] SinisterStrike        — primary builder (energy permitting)
```

### Assassination Playstyle Strategies (priority order)
```
[1]  MaintainSliceAndDice  — if SnD not active or duration < refresh_threshold

## Key Implementation Notes

### Playstyle Detection
Rogue has NO stances/forms (like Mage). Playstyle must be determined by:
- **User setting** (dropdown: "combat", "assassination", "subtlety")
- Could auto-detect via talent check, but user setting is simpler and more reliable

### No Idle Playstyle
Rogue doesn't shift forms. Unlike Druid's "caster" idle form, Rogue has no separate OOC playstyle. `idle_playstyle_name = nil`.

### Stealth Handling
Stealth is not a "playstyle" — it's a temporary state. Handle via:
- Check `is_stealthed` in context
- Opening abilities check stealth + target conditions
- After opener, fall through to normal rotation
- Stealth openers could be a high-priority strategy that only matches when stealthed + has target

### Energy/Combo Point System
Very similar to Cat Druid — reuse patterns from `cat.lua`:
- Energy pooling before finishers
- Combo point tracking via `Player:ComboPoints()`
- Energy tracking via `Player:Energy()`
- `Player:EnergyTimeToX(target, offset)` for energy prediction

### extend_context Fields
```lua
ctx.energy = Player:Energy()
ctx.cp = Player:ComboPoints()
ctx.is_stealthed = Player:IsStealthed()
ctx.is_behind = Player:IsBehind(0.3)
ctx.in_combat = Unit("player"):CombatTime() > 0
ctx.combat_time = Unit("player"):CombatTime()
ctx.is_moving = Player:IsMoving()
ctx.is_mounted = Player:IsMounted()

-- Cache invalidation flags
ctx._combat_valid = false
ctx._assassination_valid = false
ctx._subtlety_valid = false
```

### Combat State (context_builder)

    combat_state.adrenaline_rush_active = (Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(13750) or 0) > 0
    combat_state.expose_armor_active = (Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(26866) or 0) > 0

    return combat_state

    assassination_state.deadly_poison_duration = Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(27187) or 0
    assassination_state.cold_blood_active = (Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(14177) or 0) > 0
    assassination_state.find_weakness_active = (Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(31234) or 0) > 0

    return assassination_state
end
```

### Subtlety State (context_builder)
```lua
local subtlety_state = {
    snd_active = false,
    snd_duration = 0,

    rupture_duration = 0,
    hemo_debuff_active = false,

    context._subtlety_valid = true

    subtlety_state.snd_duration = Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(6774) or 0
    subtlety_state.snd_active = subtlety_state.snd_duration > 0
    subtlety_state.rupture_duration = Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(26867) or 0
    subtlety_state.rupture_active = subtlety_state.rupture_duration > 0
    subtlety_state.hemo_debuff_active = (Unit(TARGET_UNIT):HasDeBuffs(26864) or 0) > 0

    subtlety_state.master_of_subtlety_active = (Unit(PLAYER_UNIT):HasBuffs(31665) or 0) > 0

    return subtlety_state
end
```

### Class Registration
```lua
rotation_registry:register_class({
    name = "Rogue",
    version = "v1.0.0",
    playstyles = { "combat", "assassination", "subtlety" },
    idle_playstyle_name = nil,

    get_active_playstyle = function(context)
        return context.settings.playstyle or "combat"
    end,

    get_idle_playstyle = function(context)
        return nil
    end,

    extend_context = function(ctx)
        ctx.energy = Player:Energy()
        ctx.cp = Player:ComboPoints()
        ctx.is_stealthed = Player:IsStealthed()
        ctx.is_behind = Player:IsBehind(0.3)
        ctx.combat_time = Unit("player"):CombatTime()
        ctx.is_moving = Player:IsMoving()
        ctx.is_mounted = Player:IsMounted()
        ctx.enemy_count = A.MultiUnits:GetByRange(10)
        -- Cache invalidation
        ctx._combat_valid = false
        ctx._assassination_valid = false
        ctx._subtlety_valid = false
    end,
})
```

### Similarities to Cat Druid
Rogue shares many patterns with Cat Druid (`cat.lua`):
- Energy resource system (pool → build → spend)
- Combo point management
- Slice and Dice maintenance (equivalent to Cat's Savage Roar in Wrath, but SnD exists in TBC)
- Rupture DoT maintenance
- Behind-target requirements (Backstab/Mutilate like Cat's Shred)
- The `is_behind` check and positional fallbacks

Key differences from Cat:
- No form shifting — always in "rogue form"
- Stealth opener mechanic (Cat can stealth too but less emphasis)
- Envenom mechanic (consume poison stacks) — unique to Rogue
- Poisons as weapon enchants — outside rotation scope
- More cooldowns (Blade Flurry, AR, Cold Blood, Preparation, Shadowstep)
- No powershifting mechanic

### wowsims Architecture Notes
The wowsims TBC rogue sim (`sim/rogue/rotation.go`) uses a **plan-based state machine** with
these states: `PlanNone`, `PlanOpener`, `PlanSliceASAP`, `PlanMaximalSlice`, `PlanExposeArmor`,
`PlanFillBeforeEA`, `PlanFillBeforeSND`. Key implementation details:

1. **Unified rotation**: All specs share ONE rotation — only the builder spell differs
2. **Builder selection**: Configurable (SS/Mutilate/Hemo) — auto-detected from talents+weapons
3. **Shiv as builder override**: When Deadly Poison < 2s remaining, Shiv replaces builder
4. **Energy pooling**: Pool at <= 50 energy (30 during AR), only when fight > 6s remaining
5. **SnD emergency**: Cast at <= 1s remaining regardless of CP count or energy state
6. **EA build time**: Pre-calculated from energy regen rate + builder cost + finisher cost
7. **Rupture during BF**: Skipped on multi-target (Eviscerate cleaves better)
8. **End-of-fight flags**: `doneSND`/`doneEA` — stop refreshing when fight ending soon
9. **MinComboPointsForDamageFinisher**: Configurable minimum CP for using Rupture/Eviscerate
10. **Envenom**: Registered as spell but NOT used in default rotation (Rupture > Eviscerate)
11. **Thistle Tea**: Used when energy <= 40, 5 min CD with 2 min shared conjured CD
